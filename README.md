This is a PyQt5 application that allows users to design their apartments. Users can choose the type of apartment they want to personalize, apartaments with one, two, or three rooms. The application provides two main parts:

1. Predefined Layout: Where the sizes and shapes of the rooms are predefined.
2. Custom Layout: Where users can manually specify the dimensions (length and width) of the rooms.
